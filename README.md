### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized the Views of the app. I chose that area because prioritizing areas users interact with the most is very important for user engagement. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent about six hours total over two days. 
I worked on this project in the evening after work.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I decided to not implement network mocking when testing in the interest of time. In a production app relying on a real network connection, could make the tests slow, unreliable, and network issues can cause failures.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest part of the project is the lack of animations. Animations add visual flair and can increase user engagement when done properly.
